# Solution Architecture

## Overview

This solution provides automated authentication for ElasticBeanstalk applications using Amazon Cognito and Application Load Balancer (ALB). The architecture eliminates manual configuration steps and ensures consistent deployments across environments.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Amazon Cognito User Pool
- **Purpose**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Features**:
  - Email-based user registration and login
  - Password policies and security settings
  - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support
  - User profile management

### 2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Purpose**: Routes traffic and handles authentication
- **Features**:
  - Cognito authentication integration
  - HTTPS termination with SSL certificates
  - Health checks and target group management
  - Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection

### 3. ElasticBeanstalk Environment
- **Purpose**: Hosts the application with automated configuration
- **Features**:
  - Automated Cognito integration via .ebextensions
  - Environment-specific configuration management
  - Health monitoring and auto-scaling
  - Security group automation

## Data Flow

```
1. User Request → ALB (Port 443/HTTPS)
2. ALB → Cognito Authentication Check
3. If not authenticated → Redirect to Cognito Login
4. User Login → Cognito User Pool
5. Successful Auth → ALB forwards to ElasticBeanstalk
6. ElasticBeanstalk → Application Response
7. Response → ALB → User
```

## Security Features

### Authentication Flow
1. **Initial Request**: User accesses application URL
2. **Authentication Check**: ALB checks for valid authentication cookie
3. **Redirect to Login**: If not authenticated, redirect to Cognito hosted UI
4. **User Authentication**: User enters credentials in Cognito
5. **Token Exchange**: Cognito returns authorization code
6. **Session Creation**: ALB creates session cookie
7. **Application Access**: User can access protected application

### Security Groups
- **ALB Security Group**: Allows HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from internet
- **ElasticBeanstalk Security Group**: Allows traffic from ALB only
- **Database Security Group**: Allows traffic from application tier only

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- **Certificate Management**: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- **Protocol Support**: TLS 1.2 and higher
- **Cipher Suites**: Modern, secure cipher suites only
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
- **Domain**: `eb-auth-demo-dev.example.com`
- **Cognito Domain**: `eb-auth-demo-dev-{account-id}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com`
- **Features**: Debug logging, relaxed security for testing

### Staging Environment
- **Domain**: `eb-auth-demo-staging.example.com`
- **Cognito Domain**: `eb-auth-demo-staging-{account-id}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com`
- **Features**: Production-like configuration, performance testing

### Production Environment
- **Domain**: `eb-auth-demo.example.com`
- **Cognito Domain**: `eb-auth-demo-{account-id}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com`
- **Features**: High availability, monitoring, backup strategies

## Monitoring and Logging

### CloudWatch Metrics
- ALB request count and latency
- Cognito authentication success/failure rates
- ElasticBeanstalk application health
- Error rates and response times

### Log Aggregation
- ALB access logs
- Cognito authentication logs
- ElasticBeanstalk application logs
- CloudFormation deployment logs

## Scalability Considerations

### Auto Scaling
- ElasticBeanstalk auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
- ALB automatically scales to handle traffic
- Cognito scales automatically with user base

### Performance Optimization
- ALB connection draining for zero-downtime deployments
- Cognito session caching to reduce authentication overhead
- ElasticBeanstalk rolling deployments for updates

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Sizing
- Right-sized EC2 instances based on application requirements
- ALB pricing based on Load Balancer Capacity Units (LCUs)
- Cognito pricing based on Monthly Active Users (MAUs)

### Cost Monitoring
- CloudWatch billing alerts
- AWS Cost Explorer for usage analysis
- Resource tagging for cost allocation

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Cognito user pool backup via AWS Backup
- ElasticBeanstalk configuration templates
- CloudFormation templates in version control

### Recovery Procedures
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- Automated failover procedures
